# Audiere
Audiere is old--don't use it; but if you do, you can use SethRobinson Windows binaries. This fork is based on vancegroup's fork of Chad Austin's Audiere
I only made these changes out of desparation, since I wrote a whole backend based on it then found out Audiere was deprecated since 2006 on sourceforge and latest GitHub fork was 2014 and didn't work with wx 3 (the later SethRobinson fork doesn't count--it only made changes for MSVC 32-bit & 64-bit compilation, and didn't fork from vancegroup who had done many fixes).
