# The 2017 modernized GNUified release
* Now bootstrap script gives automake all the stuff it wants (no more --foreign option).
* Now full-release.sh works on linux again.
* Take note that this fork takes into account changes on GitHub (based on sourceforge svn which was last updated  2011-03-20, which had many improvements already before the GitHub forks).
* doxygen stuff is broken since this was built on linux not Cygwin (hopefully working windows stuff will come soon and will be added right here)
* wxPlayer is not working (main panel is blank; doesn't play sound, possibly due to blank panel; was modified to build under wx 3, but not fully migrated apparently)
* uninstall audiere package first; but, if you installed audiere 1.9.4 from source (`sudo make install`), you must first go to the folder where you did make, then instead do sudo make install. If you don't know how to do that or don't have the 1.9.4 source anymore, see howto at [bottom of release notes below changelog](#uninstall-previous-version)
* install using terminal (no manual download from this page required, just use these commands instead):
```
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/expertmm/Audiere/releases/download/1.10.1/audiere-1.10.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf audiere-1.10.1.tar.gz
cd audiere-1.10.1
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## HUGE ChangeLog diff since last release:

2017.12.05

  1.10.1 released.

  Restored the former build process: ./full-release.sh which now works on linux not just Cygwin (fixed the script as well as minor/dependent build scripts: bootstrap, build.sh, doxygen-dist.sh).

2017.12.03

  expertmm's fork started at https://github.com/expertmm/Audiere from https://github.com/vancegroup/Audiere
  
  tests/race/race.cpp: use cross-platform (conditionally implemented depending upon if defined _WIN32) best_sleep instead of windows.h and Sleep (otherwise prevents build of whole project)--based on <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1658386/sleep-function-in-c>
  
  SConstruct: added HAVE_SPEEX condition and if speex.h is missing, don't try to compile with it (otherwise missing speex.h [having a non-VC6 build environment] prevents build)--this determines whether to include src/speexfile/speexfile.cpp, src/input_speex.cpp.
  
  SConstruct: added use_winmm param for scons (always turned off if win32) that affects HAVE_WINMM (comment used to say "nothing checks for this" (now something does). Bug is fixed where was added to "source" variable even before check for HAVE_WINMM case added it again.
  
  moved license from doc/license.txt to LICENSE (so shows up on GitHub interface and is immediately visible)
  
  made changes suggested by autoconf:
  * add "AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS([m4])" to configure.ac
  * add "ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4" to Makefile.am

  (2017-12-03) configure.in should be configure.ac nowadays, to avoid extension inconsistency and/or theoretical name collisions

  (2017-12-03) ensured that all audiere-svn (last updated 2011) changes were applied to this fork:
  * src/basic_source.h: changed (regression) `<string.h>` to `<string>`
  * src/debug.cpp: removed `"stdlib.h"` (already had `<cstdlib>` like svn 2011 does)

  (2017-12-03) implemented all patches from <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/audiere>: these patches were made against the (very old) 1.9.4 unix source release, so changes were applied to this fork by hand (these AUR patches accepted into AUR by AUR audiere package maintainer allencch were created at unknown times between 2007-07-11 when AUR entry based on 1.9.4 release was created and 2015-06-09 when the audiere AUR package was last modified).
  
2014.09.23

  vancegroup's fork last commit uploaded (as of 2017) based on https://github.com/flibitijibibo/Audiere based on https://github.com/kg/Audiere based on ttp://tpreece.net/git/audiere.git (apparently based on svn version at original sourceforge project, since vancegroup's fork is nearly identical to it other than new features and is far different from last sourceforge release 1.9.4 from 2006). All changes logged on this date are at unknown dates between 2006.02.26 and 2014.09.23.

  The device name for DeviceFrame constructor was fudged to avoid string conversion errors (AUR patch fixes this, see 2017.12.03).
  
  HAVE_SDL and HAVE_PULSE conditions added to Makefile.am
  
  audiere.h, utility.cpp: checks for defined WIN32||_WIN32 replaced with _WIN32

  audiere.h: now does push and pop pragma warning if defined _MSC_VER, and set `#pragma warning(disable : 4786)`

  regression from string to string.h in basic_source.h (fixed, see 2017.12.03)

  debug.cpp: changed check for defined WIN32 to _WIN32

  debug.h: added `#include <cstdlib>` and changed
  ```
  #ifdef _MSC_VER
    #define ADR_ASSERT(condition, label) if (!(condition)) { __asm int 3 }
  ```
  to
  ```
  #ifdef _MSC_VER
    #include <intrin.h>
    #define ADR_ASSERT(condition, label) if (!(condition)) { __debugbreak(); }
  ```

  device.cpp:
  * make windows.h only included if defined _WIN32
  * add cases for: HAVE_WINMM, HAVE_DSOUND, HAVE_PULSE, HAVE_SDL
  * remove requirement that _MSC_VER not be defined for being able to use things other than directsound & winmm (affects the return value of `ADR_EXPORT(const char*) AdrGetSupportedAudioDevices()`)
  * added TRY_RECURSE and MAKE_DEVICE logic to replace broken NEED_SEMICOLON (and TRY_GROUP and TRY_DEVICE) logic
  * added (prioritized) check for the new sound systems mentioned earlier, in DoOpenDevice
  * added static_cast for ThreadedDevice
    
  device_ds.cpp, device_mixer.cpp, device_null.cpp, input.aiff, input_flac.cpp, input_mp3.cpp, input_speex.cpp, input_wav.cpp, loop_point_source.cpp, memory_file.cpp, resampler.cpp, sample_buffer.cpp, utility.h: parenthesis for `(std::max)` & `(std::min)` casts

  device_null.cpp: (type-o?) put extra scope braces starting on line after `ADR_GUARD...;` and ending on line before `AI_Sleep` 

  input.cpp, input_aiff.cpp, input_mp3.cpp, input_ogg.cpp, input_wav.cpp: changed `<string.h>` to `<string>`

  input_aiff.cpp: changed `#ifndef WORDS_BIGENDIAN` to `#if !defined (WORDS_BIGENDIAN) && !defined(__BIG_ENDIAN__)`

  input_ogg.cpp, input_wav.cpp: changed `#ifdef WORDS_BIGENDIAN` to `#if defined(WORDS_BIGENDIAN) || defined(__BIG_ENDIAN__)`

  input_flac.cpp, input_flac.h: changed `FLAC__StreamDecoderReadStatus FLACInputStream::read_callback`'s param `unsigned *bytes` to `size_t *bytes`

  mci_device.h: conditions for defined _M_X64

  utility.cpp: (regression) `#include <stdio.h>` (AUR patch fixes this missing include the right way, see 2017.12.03).

  utility.cpp: much more specific logic for AdrAtomic* including check for __GNUC__ and adding defines for `ADR_USE_WIN32_INTERLOCKED` and `ADR_USE_GCC_ATOMIC_INTRINSICS`

  configure.in:
  * `AC_ARG_ENABLE` for macsdl and sdl
  * added `LT_INIT`
  * added `AM_CONDITIONAL(HAVE_WXWINDOWS, false)`
  * added `AM_CONDITIONAL(HAVE_SDL, test "x$HAVE_SDL" = "xtrue")`
  * added `AC_CHECK_HEADER` for pulse/simple.h which affects new HAVE_PULSE define.

2006.02.26

  Added Lua bindings.  (Matt Campbell)


## If you already installed audiere 1.9.4 from source <a name="uninstall-previous-version"></a>
If you installed audiere 1.9.4 from source (`sudo make install`), you must first go to the folder where you did make, then instead do sudo make install. If you don't know how to do that or don't have the 1.9.4 source anymore, paste the following into terminal: 
```
cd /tmp
if [ -d audiere-build-tmp ]; then   rm -Rf audiere-build-tmp ; fi
mkdir audiere-build-tmp
if [ ! -d audiere-build-tmp ]; then
  echo "FAILED, you must do this as a user that as permission to create directories in tmp or create /tmp/audiere-build-tmp and then run:"
  echo " chown $USER /tmp/audiere-build-tmp"
  exit 1
fi
cd audiere-build-tmp
if [ -d Audiere ]; then   rm -Rf Audiere ; fi
git_path=$(command -v git)
if [ ! -f "$git_path" ]; then
  echo "You must first install git then try again."
  exit 2
fi
git clone https://github.com/expertmm/Audiere.git
if [ -d audiere-1.9.4-master ]; then   rm -Rf audiere-1.9.4-master ; fi
mv Audiere audiere-1.9.4-master
cd audiere-1.9.4-master
git reset --hard 20f9a27e70ac83dc2424ecfc16f9690e60b3f947
