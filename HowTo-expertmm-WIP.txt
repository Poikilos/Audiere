## Official How-tos
see <https://github.com/expertmm/Audiere/blob/master/examples/simple/simple.cpp>
and <https://github.com/expertmm/Audiere/blob/master/doc/faq.txt>
such as
"The OpenSound function has two modes of operation.  If the third
  argument 'streaming' is true, it just streams audio from the source.
  If 'streaming' is passed as false, it tries to load the sound into
  memory.  You probably want streaming to be true for background
  music, but false for sound effects."

## Project Status
NOTE: only forks are updated!
such as:
```
cd $HOME/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/expertmm/Audiere
cd Audiere
```

## Compiling on Windows with MSVC in 32-bit and 64-bit
see MSVC 32-bit/64-bit builds at: https://github.com/SethRobinson/Audiere (eventually those changes will be merged into this fork hopefully)

## Compiling with libtool (only needed if your *nix/bsd/MacOS system is missing the .so file)
see also README.md at https://github.com/expertmm/Audiere

### scons (original project used scons)
```
scons use_dumb=no
```

### libtool (no scons)
This method avoids scons completely--however, sudo make install doesn't put the resulting src/.libs/libaudiere-1.9.4.so in your system.
* first install all your build tools used below
* open terminal
* cd to wherever you put the project such as `cd $HOME/Documents/GitHub/Audiere`
* do the following:
```
./runme_before_automake
libtoolize
aclocal  # scans configure.ac and create an aclocal.m4 file 
# automake --add-missing will add a COPYING file, but let's not do that.
if [ ! -f COPYING ]; then
  cp LICENSE COPYING
fi
echo "change wxOPEN to wxFC_OPEN in DeviceFrame.cpp and MIDIDeviceFrame.cpp" >> ChangeLog
echo "make inclusion and uses of windows.h in src/device_mm.cpp optional" >> ChangeLog
automake --add-missing
#TODO--resolve: warning: 'INCLUDES' is the old name for 'AM_CPPFLAGS' (or '*_CPPFLAGS')
#TODO--resolve: Makefile.am:25: warning: source file 'speexfile/speexfile.cpp' is in a subdirectory,
#               src/Makefile.am:25: but option 'subdir-objects' is disabled
# * speex is only included if present on your system, so you may have to remove it to use this howto until issue is resolved.
autoreconf
#autoreconf --install  # (generates Makefile.in)
autoconf  # (generates configure script)
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Building a project that depends on audiere, using Code::Blocks:
Project, Build options, Linker settings, Other linker options: add `audiere-config --libs` including grave accents

API:
SOUND_BUFFERS is 15
SOUND_SOURCES is 20

Unicode filenames require an external library such as wx (the following is from <https://github.com/kg/Audiere/blob/master/examples/wxPlayer/DeviceFrame.cpp>):
```C++
#if wxUSE_UNICODE
  wxCharBuffer buffFilename = filename.mb_str(wxConvUTF8);
  audiere::SampleSourcePtr source = audiere::OpenSampleSource(buffFilename.data());
#else
  audiere::SampleSourcePtr source = audiere::OpenSampleSource(filename);
#endif
```
